## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Running from Source
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-mining-calculator.git
   cd ai-mining-calculator
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python ai_mining_calculator.py
   ```

### Using Pre-compiled Executables
Download the latest release for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-mining-calculator/releases) page.

## üî® Compilation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Install PyInstaller for creating standalone executables:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Windows Compilation
```bash
# Basic compilation
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed ai_mining_calculator.py

# With custom name and icon (if you have an .ico file)
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" --icon=icon.ico ai_mining_calculator.py

# Advanced options for better compatibility
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" --add-data "*.py;." ai_mining_calculator.py
```

**Output**: `dist/AI_Mining_Calculator.exe` (or `dist/ai_mining_calculator.exe`)

### macOS Compilation
```bash
# Basic compilation
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed ai_mining_calculator.py

# With custom name and icon (if you have an .icns file)
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" --icon=icon.icns ai_mining_calculator.py

# For better macOS integration
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" --osx-bundle-identifier com.yourname.aiminingcalc ai_mining_calculator.py
```

**Output**: `dist/AI_Mining_Calculator` (Unix executable)

**Note**: On macOS, you may need to allow the app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy if it's blocked.

### Linux Compilation
```bash
# Basic compilation
python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed ai_mining_calculator.py

# With custom name
python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" ai_mining_calculator.py

# For distribution (includes more libraries)
python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI_Mining_Calculator" --add-binary '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtkinter*:.' ai_mining_calculator.py
```

**Output**: `dist/AI_Mining_Calculator` (Linux executable)

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- The executable may be flagged by antivirus software (common with PyInstaller)
- Add an exception or use `--exclude-module` flags for unnecessary modules
- Consider code signing for professional distribution

#### macOS
- You may need to install tkinter separately: `brew install python-tk`
- For distribution, consider notarizing the app for Gatekeeper compatibility
- Use `--osx-bundle-identifier` for proper macOS integration

#### Linux
- Install tkinter if missing: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- For other distributions: `sudo yum install tkinter` (CentOS/RHEL)
- The executable requires the same or compatible Linux distribution to run

### Troubleshooting Compilation

1. **Missing tkinter**: Install the python3-tk package for your system
2. **Large file size**: Use `--exclude-module` to remove unnecessary modules
3. **Slow startup**: Remove `--onefile` flag to create a folder instead of single file
4. **Import errors**: Use `--add-data` or `--add-binary` flags to include missing files
